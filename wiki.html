            <p>Kohli's batting style and approach to the game have frequently drawn comparisons to the legendary Sachin
                Tendulkar, who he regarded as the epitome of excellence in the sport of cricket. Dubbed as Tendulkar's
                "successor",[19][20] he is widely considered to have the potential to surpass his records in the
                future.[21][22] His reverence for Tendulkar as a role model, who he idolized in his formative years and
                sought to emulate, is well-documented. Kohli has stated that he tried to mirror Tendulkar's style of
                batting, imitating his shots and attempting to hit sixes in a similar manner.[23] Kohli's aggressive and
                dynamic style has earned him accolades from cricketing greats such as Vivian Richards, who has
                acknowledged Kohli's similarities to his own playing style.[24] He has been lauded as the "new king of
                world cricket" by Dean Jones, a former Australian cricketer.[25] While Indian commentator Aakash Chopra
                has noted that Tendulkar possessed a broader array of shots,[26] Kohli's skills with the bat have earned
                him accolades from former West Indies great Brian Lara, who has ranked him among the best batsmen in the
                world alongside Joe Root, the England captain at the time.</p>

            <summary>Early life
            </summary>
            <p>Virat Kohli was born on 5 November 1988 in Delhi into a Punjabi Hindu family. His father, Prem Nath
                Kohli, worked as a criminal lawyer, and his mother, Saroj Kohli, served as a housewife. He has an older
                brother, Vikas, and an older sister, Bhawna.[9] Kohli's formative years were spent in Uttam Nagar. He
                commenced his early education at Vishal Bharti Public School.[10] According to his family, Kohli
                exhibited an early affinity for cricket as a three-year-old. He would pick up a cricket bat and request
                his father to bowl to him.[11]

                In 1998, the West Delhi Cricket Academy (WDCA) was created. On 30 May of that year, Prem Nath Kohli,
                who'd espoused his younger son's fervour for cricket, assisted nine-year-old Kohli's aspirations and
                arranged for him to meet Rajkumar Sharma.[12] Upon the suggestion of their neighbours, Kohli's father
                considered enrolling his son in a professional cricket academy, as they believed that his cricketing
                abilities merited more than just playing in gully cricket.[13] Despite his abilities, he faced the
                setback of being unable to secure a place in the under-14 Delhi team, supposedly due to extraneous
                factors. Prem Kohli reportedly received offers to relocate his son to influential clubs, which would
                have ensured his selection, but he declined the proposals. Kohli eventually found his way into the
                under-15 Delhi team.[14] He received training at the academy while simultaneously participating in
                matches at the Sumeet Dogra Academy located at Vasundhara Enclave.[15] In pursuit of furthering his
                cricketing career, he transitioned to Saviour Convent School during his ninth-grade education</p>
